## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light beige (#F5F5DC), evoking a sense of naturalism and calm, akin to raw canvas. It is used as the primary background.
- Background color: Off-white (#F0EAD6), nearly indistinguishable from the primary background, offering a sense of clarity and visual subtlety.
- Accent color: Muted brown (#A69078), creating a natural contrast, without taking attention away from the created content.
- Font pairing: 'Playfair' (serif) for headings to convey elegance, and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text to provide clarity. Playfair/PT Sans offer an elegant serif and highly readable sans-serif combination.
- Simple, outline-style icons for easy understanding and sleek design. Each icon represents its feature clearly, without extra detail.
- Clean, grid-based layout with ample whitespace to focus attention on content and ease navigation.
- Subtle transitions and hover effects to provide feedback and improve the user experience.
